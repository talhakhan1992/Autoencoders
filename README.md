# Autoencoders

Big data helps companies to generate valueable insights. But its not an easy task to extract valueable information from big data. So we had to make machine learnings models using big data. Those models help us in forcasting future trends.
Its not easy to train a machine learning model from big raw data. There autoencoders comes in handy. Autoencoders convert our data into latent space extracting only useful information/trend.
